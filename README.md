## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

The AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; kit (CYW920829M2EVB-01) ships with KitProg3 version 2.30 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3 with latest version 2.40. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the Firmware Loader GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error such as "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[Bluetooth&reg; LE environmental sensing service](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-ess)" application with the desired name "ess" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-btstack-freertos-ble-ess --user-app-name ess--target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

The following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/ess" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/ess" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

   **Note**: Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "\<CE Title>" is displayed on the UART terminal.

5. To test using the LightBlue&reg; mobile app, do the following (see equivalent LightBlue&reg; app screenshots in Figure 1):

    1. Turn ON Bluetooth&reg; on your Android or iOS device.

    2. Launch the LightBlue&reg; app.

    3. Press the reset switch on the supported kit to start sending advertisements.

    4. Swipe down on the LightBlue&reg; app home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth&reg; LE Peripherals; your device ("Thermistor") appears in the LightBlue&reg; app home screen. Select your device to establish a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection. Once the connection is established, LED1 changes from OFF state to always ON state.

    5. Select **Environmental Sensing Service** and tap **SUBSCRIBE**.

         The temperature values will be updated every 5 seconds in representations such as HEX.

    **Figure 1. Testing with the LightBlue&reg; app on android**

    ![](images/fig_1.png)

6.  Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth&reg; stack and application trace messages in the terminal window.

    **Figure 2. Log messages on KitProg3 COM port**

    ![](./images/fig2.logmessages.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Eclipse_IDE_for_ModusToolbox_User_Guide_1-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99bcb86331e8).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging PSoC&trade; 6 MCU)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/PSoC-6-MCU-Code-in-main-executes-before-the-debugger-halts-at-the-first-line-of/ta-p/253856) to learn about this and for the workaround. *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

## Design and implementation

### Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example. ModusToolbox&trade; software stores the device configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file and Bluetooth&reg; configuration settings of the application in the *design.cybt* file. This file is used by the graphical configurators, which generate the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

- **Device Configurator:** Used to enable/configure the peripherals and the pins used in the application. For detailed information on how to use it, see the
[Device Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Device_Configurator_Guide_4-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99ab297631cb).

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** Used for generating/modifying the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database. For detailed information on how to use it, see the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_Bluetooth_Configurator_Guide_3-UserManual-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d718a49017d99aaf5b231be).

**Note:** For PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE-based BSPs(CY8CKIT-062-BLE, CY8CPROTO-063-BLE, and CYBLE-416045-EVAL) with support for AIROC&trade; BTSTACK, if you want to use the bt-configurator tool, select the *AIROC&trade; BTSTACK with Bluetooth&reg; LE only (CYW20829, PSoC&trade; 6 with CYW43xxx Connectivity device)* option from the drop-down to select the device. Do not use the *PSoC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; LE Legacy Stack (PSoC&trade; 6-BLE)* option because it is not compatible with AIROC&trade; BTSTACK.

This code example is written in a way that is generic across multiple devices and platforms. The code example application runs on the Arm&reg; Cortex&reg; core of the MCU device. The functionality of the code example will remain the same on all the supported kits; the application was developed using the ModusToolbox&trade; software.

This application demonstrates the Bluetooth&reg; LE peripheral capability of the supported kit. The simulated temperature value is sent over Bluetooth&reg; LE to a Central device, and to the UART as debug trace messages. This project demonstrates the following features:

- Bluetooth&reg; LE Environment Sensing Service (ESS) – GATT Read and Notify functionality
- Debug trace messages
- Connection with one Central device
- Connection status indication through LED

The project consists of the following files:

**Table 1. Important user-application-related source files**

|**File name**|**Comments**|
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|*main.c* | Contains the `main()` function, which is the entry point for execution of the user application code after device startup.|
|*cycfg_bt_settings.c, cycfg_bt_settings.h* |    Contain the runtime Bluetooth&reg; stack configuration parameters such as device name and  advertisement/ connection settings. Note that the name that the device uses for advertising (“Thermistor”) is defined in *app_bt_cfg.c*.|
|*app_bt_gatt_handler.c, app_bt_gatt_handler.h*|Contain the code for the Bluetooth&reg; stack GATT event handler functions. |
|*cycfg_gatt_db.c, cycfg_gatt_db.h*|    Contain the GATT database information generated using the Bluetooth&reg; configurator tool. These files reside in the *GeneratedSource* folder under the application folder.|

#### Flowchart

**Figure 3. Bluetooth&reg; LE environmental sensing service application**

![](images/fig3.flowchart.png)

This flowchart provides an overview of the Environmental Sensing Profile application. The Environmental Sensing Profile in this application consists of one of the Bluetooth&reg; SIG-defined services, namely the "Environment Sensing Service" (ESS). This project implements only the Temperature characteristic from the Environmental Sensing service. This characteristic supports notification and read operations, which allow the GATT Server to send data to the connected GATT Client device whenever new data is available, and a read to be performed from the GATT Client device.

The Bluetooth&reg; Configurator provided by ModusToolbox&trade; software makes it easier to design and implement the GATT DB. The Bluetooth&reg; Configurator generates the *cycfg_gatt_db.c* and *cycfg_gatt_db.h* files. All Environmental Sensing profile-related variables and functions are contained in these files. When the GATT DB is initialized after Bluetooth&reg; stack initialization, all profile-related values will be ready to be advertised to the Central device. See the *ModusToolbox&trade; software Bluetooth&reg; Configurator guide* for details.

The code example generates dummy temperature values between 20 degree and 30 degree celsius. Every 5 seconds, the temperature varies by 1 degree celsius. A timer callback gives this simulated temperature value, which is then sent every 5 seconds to the Central device when connected and GATT notifications are enabled by the Central.

When the Peripheral device is connected, LED1 will be ON; when it is disconnected, LED1 will be OFF. To turn the LED ON and OFF, generic GPIO functions are used to drive the output pin HIGH or LOW. The LEDs present in the supported kits are active LOW LEDs, which means that the LED turns ON when the GPIO is driven LOW.

The *app_bt_gatt_handler.c* and *app_bt_gatt_handler.h* files handle the functionality of GATT callbacks from the Central device. On receiving a connection request, the Bluetooth&reg; stack gives a GATT event to the application of `wiced_bt_gatt_evt_t` type.

For example, the LED toggle functionality is implemented in the GATT connection callback. On a disconnection event, the code resets the Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (CCCD) value so that on a reconnect event, notifications will be disabled.

In *cycfg_bt_settings.c,* all the runtime Bluetooth&reg; stack configuration parameters are defined; these will be initialized during Bluetooth&reg; stack initialization. Some of the configurations include the device name, connection interval, advertisement interval, advertisement channels to use, number of client connections, and maximum transmission unit (MTU). You also have the flexibility to configure the buffer pool size, which helps in optimizing the memory and transmission rate depending on the application use case.

The project also contains *app_bt_utils.c* and *app_bt_utils.h* which provide APIs to see meaningful messages in debug logs in the debug UART. Most of the status messages the in Bluetooth&reg; stack are represented in enumerated values. These functions allow you to view the respective strings instead of the enumerated values.

This application uses a modified *FreeRTOSConfig.h* file to work. Here, the `configTIMER_TASK_PRIORITY` is changed to *6* for the timer task and `configTIMER_TASK_STACK_DEPTH` is changed to *256*. In addition, two other minor modifications are made to the default *FreeRTOSConfig.h* file.
